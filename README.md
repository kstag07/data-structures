For the LinkedList I created a node class and a Linked list class. I created insert search remove size and to_s methods.

For my Stack I based my logic off of my LinkedList and used more simple versions of insert and remove for my push and pop methods.

For my Queue I based my logic off of my Stack except I added a tail to keep track of, I used my push method from stack but replaced it with a tail and I used my exact same pop method from my Stack.
